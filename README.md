Includes my notes and solutions to the exercises.

This mosly serves as a documentations for myself(my neovim configurations).

Two config files:
1. `init.lua` -- my neovim config
2. `bashrc` -- my terminal bash config

the bashrc includes some QoL features such as auto activating python venvs when cding into a directory.
